# zhoo-vscode

the `zhoo` syntax highlighting, this extension is not finished yet and will evolve along with the language.    

## install

- add the `zhoo-vscode` directory into your `vscode` extensions folder    

		open $HOME/.vscode/extensions

- quit `vscode`   
- open `vscode`   

now your can choose `zhoo` with the `select language mode` button in your `vscode` footer. but normally it should be detected by the software if the file has the `.zo` file extension.		

## issues

- `real` is not highlighting properly for example this: `1.0E+77` do not work.    
- `and` is not highlight with `type` declaration.
