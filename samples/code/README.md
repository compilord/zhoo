# code

a directory of programs to demonstrate how to solve problems with `zhoo`.   

the main idea will be to demonstrate that the language is turing complete. to do this, the language must be able to implement [rule 110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110#:~:text=Rule%20110%20is%20arguably%20the,and%20interact%20in%20complex%20ways.).   

from there, why not try to make the compiler be able to implement the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
